NOT NULL Constraint 	-- Ensures that a column cannot have Null value

DEFAULT Constraint  	-- Provides a default value for a column where none is specified/ given or value not 				   inserted, 
			   Eg: auto generate Pass@123 for all the user appering for assessment

UNIQUE Constraint   	-- Ensures that all the values in column are different
			   Eg: no repeatation of number, it could be your adhaar card, pan no, bank account no,
			   skills, background, interests, problems, goals, vision 

CHECK Constraint    	-- Makes sure that all values in column satisfy certain given criteria
			   Eg: no negative numbers, year must be greater then 2000, age greater then 18, age 				   between 11 - 18

PRIMARY KEY Constraint  -- Used to Uniquely Identify a row in a table, cannot be NULL and must have all UNIQUE/ 			   different values

#COMBINING QUERIES (UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, INTERSSECT ALL EXCEPT)

**structure of output from both the two queries should be same

UNION
   UNION operator must have same numbe rof field in the result set with similar datatypes,

#SUBQUERY
In in sub query can have one column only


#----------------------JOINS
--JOINING/COMBINING INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE TABLE FOR DATA INTERPRETATION, FINDINGS
EG: 1) we want to find customer who haven't purchased anything from us
    2) we want to give discounts/offers on technology products
    3) I want to allocate marketing budget to different regions, find region-wise total sales for me

-To Join tables what we need to know ?
	1) Names of tables to be joined
	2) Common column based on which we will  join them
	3) The list of columns from each table

****** If there are duplicates/repeatation in common columns used to join 2 or more tables then it causes duplication in mapped result set too

for example:

MariaDB [ssk]> select * from demo;
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | phone      |
+----+------+------------+
|  1 | a    | 2147483647 |
|  2 | b    |       1213 |
|  3 | c    |       3422 |
+----+------+------------+


MariaDB [ssk]> select * from demo1;
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | phone      |
+----+------+------------+
|  4 | a    | 2147483647 | * a
|  5 | a    |       1213 |
|  6 | fc   |       3422 | * a
|  7 | a    |         12 | * a
+----+------+------------+


MariaDB [ssk]> SELECT * FROM demo INNER JOIN demo1 ON demo.name = demo1.name;
+----+------+------------+----+------+------------+
| id | name | phone      | id | name | phone      |
+----+------+------------+----+------+------------+
|  1 | a    | 2147483647 |  4 | a    | 2147483647 |
|  1 | a    | 2147483647 |  5 | a    |       1213 |
|  1 | a    | 2147483647 |  7 | a    |         12 |
+----+------+------------+----+------+------------+

here you can see id,name,phone(col1,col2,col3) of demo having name = "a" are repeated thrice as it has entry of name = "a" 3 times in demo1

*****so, we must select common column such that there exists no duplicate/repeatative values in common column of joined tables

-------------------------------------------

# INNER JOIN / SIMPLE JOIN 
--select common column from both tables
-- find intersection of specified column in join condition

- Syntax:
SELECT col FROM table_1 INNER JOIN table_2 ON table_1.common_field = table_2.common_field

MariaDB [ssk]> select * from customer_table;
+----+--------+-------+----------------+
| id | name   | phone | email          |
+----+--------+-------+----------------+
|  1 | sukh   |   123 | sukh@xyz.com   |
|  2 | kitu   |   456 | kitu@xyz.com   |

# LEFT OUTER JOIN / LEFT JOIN
- Select all columns present in left table and matching columns from right table
- We get NULL from right table in this type of join
- eg:
  we want to find customer who haven't purchased anything from us so there order details from right table(order) will contain Null values as they haven't purchased anything yet, so data is not present in order tables and only present in customer table

-Syntax:
SELECT col FROM table_1 LEFT JOIN table_2 ON table_1.common_field = table_2.common_field



# RIGHT OUTER JOIN/ RIGHT JOIN
- Select all columns present in right table and matching columns from left table
- We get NULL from left table in this type of join
- eg:
   we get sales from new customers who are not in our customer table, so to find that we do right join on them keeping (customer) table on left and (sales) table on right as there is no data available of this new customer in our customer table, we will get new customers from our sales table

-Syntax:
SELECT col FROM table_1 RIGHT JOIN table_2 ON table_1.common_field = table_2.common_field


# FULL OUTER JOIN/ FULL JOIN
- select all columns present in both tables
- combines both the results of left and right outer joins
- mysql does not support full outer join.
- so, we can union left and right outer joins to get the same results as full outer join

Syntax:
SELECT col FROM table_1 FULL JOIN table_2 ON table_1.common_field = table_2.common_field


# CROSS JOIN / CARTESIAN PRODUCT

Syntax:
SELECT table1.col, table1.col, ... FROM table1,table2,[table3];

- takes both the tables, for every row in table1 it will map all the values in table2
- useful when something repeatative needs to be joined together 

eg 1): mapping years with each month
i.e one month table having all the 12 months, other year table having desired years to be mapped with months
	SELECT a.YYYY, b.mm FROM year_table AS a, month_table AS b;

eg 2): table a = {1,2,3,4}
       table b = {5,6,7}
cartesian product  = {(1,5) (1,6) (1,7)
		      (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)
		      (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)
		      (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)
